Reciproal Space Mapping
=======================================

Software for mapping raw surface x-ray diffraction images into reciprocal space. For mapping datasets such as crystal truncation rods (CTRs) into HKL volumes fast_rsm uses routines created at Diamond Light Source. However for processing graxing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) datasets fast_rsm uses routines within the package `pyFAI`_ 

`usage at diamond`_ - detailed instructions on how to use fast_rsm at i07. If you requied any extra assistance, ask a beamline member of staff or email philip.mousley@diamond.ac.uk
